# Project Plan

## For Stack Installation Simplification and Version Awareness

- **Version:** 0.1
- **Author:** Codex
- **Date:** 2026-02-21
- **Status:** Approved

---

## Overview

Deliver a guided single-command setup/upgrade experience, plus version awareness and update reminders in Canvas and CLI. The rollout prioritizes installation simplification first, then shared version metadata, then reminder UX behavior. Update reminders are stable-release-only, and development/private builds do not emit reminder prompts.

- Requirements: `./1_requirements.md`
- Design: `./2_design.md`

## Validation Gates

- Python changes: `make format`, `make lint`, and targeted `uv run pytest ...` for installer/backend/CLI tests.
- Canvas changes: `make canvas-format`, `make canvas-lint`, and targeted Canvas tests.
- Release readiness: verify reminders appear once per 24h and never block command execution.
