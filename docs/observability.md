# Observability Instrumentation

## Execution History Enhancements
- Each workflow step now captures prompts, responses, token usage, and generated artifacts.
- Aggregated token metrics are surfaced via the REST API to feed dashboards and alerting rules.
- The in-memory history store exposes metadata suitable for building an execution viewer with replay controls.

## Metrics Pipeline
- Workflow run creation, success, and failure events are recorded via the in-memory `MetricRecorder`.
- Metrics are tagged by workflow identifier and triggering actor, enabling dashboard segmentation.
- A summary endpoint (to be wired in the API) can emit aggregated metrics for Grafana or Looker ingestion.

## Monitoring Dashboards
- Saved versions and shareable exports can be diffed to monitor configuration drift.
- WebSocket instrumentation streams live execution status for real-time dashboards.
- Credential governance alerts surface expiring secrets before production incidents occur.
