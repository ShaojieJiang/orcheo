# Project Plan

## For Private Bot Listener Nodes

- **Version:** 0.1
- **Author:** Codex
- **Date:** 2026-03-11
- **Status:** Approved

## Overview

Deliver optional workflow-attached listener nodes that keep Telegram, Discord, and QQ bots connected without requiring a public Orcheo callback URL. For QQ, the implementation should use Tencent's AppID/AppSecret authentication and `/gateway` WebSocket session model, matching the official OpenClaw plugin approach.
The deliverable also includes Canvas templates that prove the listener nodes work in actual workflows: one template per platform with an `AgentNode` generating the reply, plus one template with Telegram, Discord, and QQ listeners in parallel sharing the same `AgentNode`. If a platform is missing a reply/send node, adding that minimal outbound node stays inside scope until the template is runnable end to end.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Listener Foundations

**Description:** Add the core subscription model and runtime supervision needed for any long-lived listener.

#### Task Checklist

- [ ] Task 1.1: Define listener node schemas for Telegram and Discord.
  - Dependencies: None
- [ ] Task 1.2: Extend workflow activation logic to extract listener subscriptions from workflow graphs.
  - Dependencies: Task 1.1
- [ ] Task 1.3: Add persistence for `listener_subscription`, `listener_cursor`, and short-lived dedupe records.
  - Dependencies: Task 1.2
- [ ] Task 1.4: Implement a listener supervisor process with leasing, health reporting, and graceful shutdown.
  - Dependencies: Task 1.3
- [ ] Task 1.5: Add `triggered_by="listener"` dispatch plumbing into the existing run queue.
  - Dependencies: Task 1.4
- [ ] Task 1.6: Define the workflow/runtime contract that allows multiple listener nodes to feed the same downstream `AgentNode` and preserve correct reply routing metadata.
  - Dependencies: Task 1.5
- [ ] Task 1.7: Audit reply-node availability for Telegram, Discord, and QQ, and mark missing outbound nodes as required deliverables for template completion instead of follow-up work.
  - Dependencies: Task 1.6
- [ ] Task 1.8: Define Canvas template acceptance criteria, owner metadata, and template versioning rules tied to Orcheo and provider API versions.
  - Dependencies: Task 1.6

### Milestone 2: Telegram Private Listener

**Description:** Deliver Telegram long polling as the first fully supported private-network bot listener that does not require a public callback URL.

#### Task Checklist

- [ ] Task 2.1: Implement `TelegramBotListenerNode` validation and Canvas/SDK registration.
  - Dependencies: Milestone 1
- [ ] Task 2.2: Implement Telegram `getUpdates` adapter with offset persistence and backoff.

- [ ] Task 2.4: Reuse or align with existing `TelegramEventsParserNode` and `MessageTelegram` behavior where sensible.
  - Dependencies: Task 2.3
- [ ] Task 2.5: Add tests for polling, restart recovery, dedupe, and two independent Telegram bot configurations.
  - Dependencies: Task 2.4
- [ ] Task 2.6: Add a Canvas template private Telegram bot workflow with `TelegramBotListenerNode -> AgentNode -> MessageTelegram`.
  - Dependencies: Task 2.5
- [ ] Task 2.7: Add operator documentation for the Telegram listener template and deployment flow.
  - Dependencies: Task 2.5

  - Dependencies: Task 3.2
- [ ] Task 3.4: Add dispatch normalization and dedupe for Discord message events.
  - Dependencies: Task 3.3
- [ ] Task 3.5: Add tests for heartbeat timing, resume flow, identify/session-start rate limits, message content intent handling, and event dispatch.
  - Dependencies: Task 3.4
- [ ] Task 3.6: Deliver a supported Discord outbound reply node if an adequate one does not already exist for listener-triggered workflows.
  - Dependencies: Task 3.5, Task 1.7
- [ ] Task 3.7: Add a Canvas template private Discord bot workflow with `DiscordBotListenerNode -> AgentNode -> MessageDiscord` or the final equivalent node name.
  - Dependencies: Task 3.6
- [ ] Task 3.8: Add operator documentation for the Discord listener template and deployment flow.
  - Dependencies: Task 3.7

### Milestone 4: Operations and Productization

**Description:** Make listener-based bots operable in production private deployments.

#### Task Checklist

- [ ] Task 4.1: Add listener health surfaces to API/UI/CLI as appropriate.
  - Dependencies: Milestone 2, Milestone 3
- [ ] Task 4.2: Add pause/resume or disable controls for listener subscriptions.
  - Dependencies: Task 4.1
- [ ] Task 4.3: Add metrics and alerts for stalled listeners, reconnect loops, and dispatch failures.
  - Dependencies: Task 4.1
- [ ] Task 4.4: Add a Canvas template with Telegram, Discord, and QQ listeners in parallel sharing one `AgentNode`, and validate that each listener replies with the matching bot identity through supported workflow nodes only.
  - Dependencies: Milestone 2, Milestone 3, Milestone 5
- [ ] Task 4.5: Document deployment topology for private hosts, worker separation, secret management, and template workflow usage.
  - Dependencies: Task 4.3
- [ ] Task 4.6: Add template compatibility tracking so provider API changes or reply-node contract changes trigger template revalidation and a version bump.
  - Dependencies: Task 4.4, Task 1.8
