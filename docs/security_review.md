# Security Review Summary

Date: 2025-01-08

## Scope
- Credential vault encryption and OAuth refresh flows
- Trigger ingress (webhook, cron, manual, HTTP polling)
- Execution backend and WebSocket streaming layer

## Findings
- **Credential storage**: Verified AES-GCM encryption and rotation policies. Added governance alerts to highlight expiring OAuth tokens.
- **OAuth validation**: Exercised the new credential templates API and OAuth service to ensure refreshes are audited and health checks gate execution.
- **Trigger hardening**: Reviewed rate limiting, signature validation, and overlap controls. Added HTTP polling guard rails with signature deduplication.
- **Observability**: Confirmed token metrics and artifact capture prevent sensitive leakage in logs.

## Remediations
- Added credential template issuance endpoints with governance alerts.
- Instrumented execution history to track prompts, responses, token usage, and artifacts.
- Recorded workflow run success/failure metrics for anomaly detection.

## Status
All critical issues have been addressed. Follow-up items are tracked in the onboarding playbook.
