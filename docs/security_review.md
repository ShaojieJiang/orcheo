# Security Review Summary

The Orcheo platform underwent a focused security assessment covering the
credential vault, trigger ingestion surface, and workflow execution runtime.

## Highlights

- **Penetration testing** simulated credential brute force attempts, webhook
  signature bypasses, and workflow replay abuse. No critical vulnerabilities were
  identified; rate limiting and shared-secret validation mitigated attacks.
- **Threat modeling** workshops enumerated entry points, actors, and mitigation
  strategies. High-impact scenarios (credential exfiltration, trigger DoS, supply
  chain tampering) now have concrete countermeasures and operational runbooks.
- **Credential governance** alerts integrate with the new template registry to
  flag expiring tokens, misconfiguration, and rotation drift before execution is
  allowed.
- **Operational hardening** added audit logging for vault mutations, scoped API
  tokens for automation clients, and guardrail policies for AI responses.

The review ensures Milestone 3 deliverables satisfy the security posture
required for beta launch and lays a foundation for the enterprise roadmap.
