# Beta Launch Reliability Plan

## Reliability Testing
- End-to-end workflow execution is exercised via the WebSocket harness in the designer.
- HTTP polling triggers include signature deduplication to prevent duplicate runs under load.
- Guardrails enforce prompt length and response score thresholds prior to publish.

## Load Testing
- Canvas interactions were profiled with the minimap enabled to validate pan/zoom performance.
- Undo/redo history retains 20 revisions by default to keep memory footprint predictable.

## Regional Rollout
- Phase 1 (NA/EU): enable credential templates and governance alerts.
- Phase 2 (APAC/LatAm): expand metrics export to downstream observability stacks.
- Success metrics captured via `MetricRecorder` help evaluate adoption across cohorts.
