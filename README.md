Orcheo is a workflow orchestration platform designed for vibe coding — AI coding agents like Claude Code can start services, build workflows, and deploy them for you automatically. Read the [full documentation](https://orcheo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for guides, API reference, and examples.

> **Note:** This project is currently in Beta. Expect breaking changes as we iterate rapidly towards 1.0.

> **SIGIR Reviewers:** See the **[Conversational Search Examples](https://orcheo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/conversational_search/)** for step-by-step demos from basic RAG to production-ready search.

## Why Orcheo?

- **Vibe-coding-first**: Already using Claude Code, Codex CLI, or Cursor? You **don't** need to learn Orcheo. Install the [agent skill](https://github.com/ShaojieJiang/agent-skills) and let your AI agent handle setup, workflow creation, and deployment.
- **Python-native**: Workflows are Python code powered by LangGraph — no proprietary DSL to learn.
- **Backend-first**: Run headless in production; the UI is optional.

## Quick Start

Use the installation path that matches your setup:

> Prerequisite: Docker Desktop/Engine must be installed to run the stack (`orcheo install --start-stack`).

<details open>
<summary>macOS/Linux (bootstrap)</summary>

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ai-colleagues.com/install.sh | sh
```

```bash
# Unattended full stack from scratch
curl -fsSL https://ai-colleagues.com/install.sh | sh -s -- --yes --start-stack
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Windows PowerShell (bootstrap)</summary>

```powershell
irm https://ai-colleagues.com/install.ps1 | iex
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>SDK tooling (skip bootstrap)</summary>

```bash
uv tool install orcheo-sdk
orcheo install
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Upgrade existing installation</summary>

```bash
orcheo install upgrade --yes
```

</details>

`orcheo install` syncs Docker stack assets into `~/.orcheo/stack` (or
`ORCHEO_STACK_DIR`), updates `.env` with setup-selected values, and can start the
stack with Docker Compose. Setup will prompt for
`VITE_ORCHEO_CHATKIT_DOMAIN_KEY`; you can skip it and continue, but ChatKit UI
features will stay disabled until you set a valid key.

The fastest way to get started with workflow building is still the **Agent Skill** approach.

> **Note:** Most AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor) require a paid subscription. Free alternatives may exist but have not been tested with Orcheo.

### 1. Install the Orcheo Agent Skill

Add the [Orcheo agent skill](https://github.com/ShaojieJiang/agent-skills) to your AI coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) by following the installation instructions in the repo.

### 2. Let Your Agent Do the Work

Once installed, simply ask your agent to:

- **Set up Orcheo**: "Set up Orcheo for local development"
- **Create workflows**: "Create a workflow that monitors RSS feeds and sends Slack notifications"
- **Deploy workflows**: "Deploy and schedule my workflow to run every hour"

Your AI agent will automatically:
- Install dependencies
- Start the backend server
- Create and configure workflows
- Handle authentication and deployment

That's it! Your agent handles the complexity while you focus on describing what you want your workflows to do.
