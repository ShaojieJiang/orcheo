# Frontend Experience Design & Implementation Plan

## Purpose
This document captures the actionable plan for evolving the Orcheo canvas from its current developer-centric prototype into a production-ready, user-centered experience. It consolidates design and engineering activities so product, design, and frontend contributors can execute in lockstep while staying aligned with backend capabilities.

## Current Baseline Assessment
- **Migrated canvas foundation**: The legacy canvas now runs on the refreshed React Flow surface with minimap, snapping, and chat affordances, but undo/redo history, duplication/export actions, and search remain unimplemented.
- **Monolithic application shell**: A single React component orchestrates data fetching, state management, and UI for credential templates, issuance, and governance alerts, making the codebase brittle and hard to extend.
- **Ad-hoc styling**: One global stylesheet applies hard-coded gradients, colors, and breakpoints, offering no reusable tokens or component-level theming for future surfaces.
- **Minimal UX coverage**: Empty, loading, and error states are limited to simple banners, and there is no formalized navigation or information architecture to guide feature growth.
- **Testing gap**: Automated coverage is limited to a navigation smoke test, leaving interaction flows, validation logic, and API error handling unverified.

## Objectives
1. Establish a user-centered navigation and layout that separates credential templates, issuance workflows, and governance alerts into dedicated, deep-linkable views.
2. Create a scalable design system with documented tokens, components, and responsive behavior to accelerate feature velocity while ensuring accessibility.
3. Modularize the frontend architecture into feature-first domains with clear data/service boundaries, paving the way for richer workflows and real-time updates.
4. Raise quality confidence by expanding component, integration, and accessibility testing around critical user journeys.

## Design & Research Track
| Phase | Goals | Key Activities | Deliverables |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Discovery | Align on personas, jobs-to-be-done, and backend constraints | Stakeholder interviews, API contract review, audit of current fetch logic | Updated journey map, API capability matrix |
| Information Architecture | Define navigation, routing, and content hierarchy | Task modeling, sitemap sketches, low-fidelity wireframes | Signed-off IA diagram, annotated wireframes |
| Visual Design System | Establish reusable tokens and component patterns | Token palette creation, component inventory, responsive spec | Design tokens library, component spec sheets |
| Validation | Confirm usability and accessibility of proposed flows | Usability walkthroughs, a11y heuristic review, design QA checklist | Usability findings log, accessibility checklist |

## Implementation Track
| Workstream | Description | Owner Roles | Milestones |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend Architecture | Restructure codebase into `features/<domain>` folders, introduce routing, and centralize API services by standardizing on React Query for data fetching and caching. | Frontend lead, supporting engineers | Week 1: file structure refactor; Week 2: shared services & hooks in place |
| Component Library | Implement primitives (buttons, inputs, panels, banners) powered by the new token system, documenting them in Storybook to enable visual regression checks. | UI engineer, designer | Week 2: tokens + base components; Week 3: complex components (tables, forms) |
| Feature Implementation | Rebuild templates, issuance, and alerts screens with new components, state handling, and clear empty/loading/error states. | Feature squads | Week 3: templates; Week 4: issuance; Week 5: alerts |
| Quality & Tooling | Expand Vitest/Test Library coverage, add axe-based accessibility checks, and wire lint/test to pre-commit CI gates. | QA engineer, frontend lead | Week 2: test harness scaffolding; Week 5: >80% critical flow coverage |
| Documentation & Handoff | Maintain design system docs, contribution guidelines, and release notes for frontend changes. | Designer, tech writer | Ongoing; Week 5: publish contribution guide |

## Cross-Functional Dependencies
- **Backend**: Confirm API stability for credential templates, issuance, and alerts; expose pagination and filtering endpoints needed for advanced UI controls.
- **Security**: Validate that credential displays and alert acknowledgements meet compliance requirements before UI polish.
- **DevOps**: Align on build pipeline (Vite, lint, tests) and preview environment strategy for stakeholder reviews.

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design debt persists due to split priorities | UI remains inconsistent and slows feature velocity | Timebox weekly design reviews and enforce component usage via lint rules or Storybook docs |
| Backend contracts shift mid-implementation | Rework screens and data handling | Lock API change window during Weeks 3â€“5; document versioned contracts |
| Accessibility gaps emerge late | Requires costly post-hoc fixes | Integrate axe checks in CI and run keyboard/screen-reader passes each sprint |

## Success Metrics
- **Adoption**: 90% of new UI work consumes shared components and tokens.
- **Quality**: Frontend CI passes lint, test, and accessibility checks with zero regressions across critical flows.
- **Usability**: Positive feedback from at least three usability walkthroughs covering each primary persona.
- **Velocity**: Feature squads report <10% time spent on styling or layout churn after component library adoption.

## Next Steps Checklist
- [ ] Kick off the Discovery phase to synthesize personas, task flows, and API constraints.
- [ ] Define the information architecture and navigation model through low-fidelity wireframes.
- [ ] Establish design tokens and component guidelines for the shared UI library.
- [ ] Restructure the frontend into feature-first modules with centralized data services.
- [ ] Rebuild templates, issuance, and alerts experiences using the new components and state patterns.
- [ ] Expand automated testing and accessibility checks to cover critical user journeys.
