# Project Plan

## For Orcheo Plugin Ecosystem

- **Version:** 0.1
- **Author:** Codex
- **Date:** 2026-03-16
- **Status:** Draft

---

## Overview

Deliver a managed plugin mechanism for nodes, edges, agent tools, triggers, and listeners, with the CLI as the supported operator interface. The project removes the current `sitecustomize`-based extension workflow, replaces it with explicit plugin lifecycle management, and validates the listener abstraction by shipping WeCom and Lark listener plugins.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Plugin Foundations and CLI Lifecycle

**Description:** Define the plugin contract, managed state, and CLI lifecycle commands so plugins can be installed and reconciled without manual environment manipulation.

#### Task Checklist

- [ ] Task 1.1: Define `PluginManifest`, plugin API versioning, and entry point contract.
  - Dependencies: None
- [ ] Task 1.2: Implement plugin state files for desired state and lock state.
  - Dependencies: Task 1.1
- [ ] Task 1.3: Define and document the default plugin filesystem layout under `~/.orcheo/plugins/` plus cache placement under `~/.cache/orcheo/plugins/`.
  - Dependencies: Task 1.2
- [ ] Task 1.4: Add CLI commands `orcheo plugin list`, `show`, `install`, `update`, `uninstall`, `enable`, `disable`, and `doctor`.
  - Dependencies: Task 1.2, Task 1.3
- [ ] Task 1.5: Support package, local path, wheel, and Git install references in the CLI.
  - Dependencies: Task 1.4
- [ ] Task 1.6: Implement compatibility checks for plugin API version and Orcheo version ranges.
  - Dependencies: Task 1.1
- [ ] Task 1.7: Add impact analysis that classifies plugin changes as silent hot-reloadable, confirmation-required, or restart/reconcile-required.
  - Dependencies: Task 1.1, Task 1.2
- [ ] Task 1.8: Add fixture plugins used by automated tests for nodes, edges, and listeners.
  - Dependencies: Task 1.1
- [ ] Task 1.9: Implement `orcheo plugin doctor` with the full diagnostic check set specified in the design.
  - Dependencies: Task 1.4, Task 1.6
- [ ] Task 1.10: Add integration tests for install, update, uninstall, enable, disable, broken-plugin handling, maintainer prompts for impactful changes, and `orcheo plugin doctor` output.
  - Dependencies: Task 1.4, Task 1.6, Task 1.7, Task 1.8, Task 1.9
- [ ] Task 1.11: Implement transactional install and update semantics so a failed install or update leaves the previous locked state intact and the plugin venv in its pre-operation state.
  - Dependencies: Task 1.4, Task 1.5

### Milestone 2: Runtime Loading and Registry Expansion

**Description:** Load enabled plugins safely at startup and make all v1 component surfaces externally extensible.

- [ ] Task 2.4b: Refactor the listener compiler to look up compiler hooks from the listener registry rather than branching on hard-coded platform values.
  - Dependencies: Task 2.4a
- [ ] Task 2.4c: Refactor the listener runtime/supervisor to instantiate adapters through the registry's adapter factory rather than built-in constructors.
  - Dependencies: Task 2.4b
- [ ] Task 2.4d: Update API response shapes and serialization to use string platform identifiers consistently.
  - Dependencies: Task 2.4a
- [ ] Task 2.5: Implement generation-aware activation for hot-reloadable node, edge, and agent-tool plugins so new runs can use the updated generation while older runs drain.
  - Dependencies: Task 2.2, Milestone 1
- [ ] Task 2.6: Expose plugin-provided components through existing discovery flows such as `orcheo node list` and `orcheo edge list`.
  - Dependencies: Task 2.2, Task 2.3
- [ ] Task 2.7: Add startup and reconciliation tests covering compatible, incompatible, disabled, hot-reloadable, and restart-required plugins.
  - Dependencies: Task 2.1, Task 2.5, Task 2.6

### Milestone 3: Edge Naming and Compatibility Migration

**Description:** Standardize built-in edge naming with an `Edge` suffix while preserving backward compatibility for existing workflows and docs.

#### Task Checklist

- [ ] Task 3.1: Rename core edge classes to canonical `*Edge` names such as `IfElseEdge`, `SwitchEdge`, and `WhileEdge`.
  - Dependencies: Task 2.2 (edge registration API)
- [ ] Task 3.2: Add legacy aliases so existing graph definitions using old edge names continue to load.
  - Dependencies: Task 3.1
- [ ] Task 3.3: Update edge catalog, docs, and scaffolds to emit canonical edge names.
  - Dependencies: Task 3.1
- [ ] Task 3.4: Add tests covering legacy edge-name compatibility and canonical-name discovery.
  - Dependencies: Task 3.2
- [ ] Task 3.5: Ensure plugin-authored edges follow the same naming guidance and discovery contract.
  - Dependencies: Task 3.3

### Milestone 4: WeCom Listener Plugin Validation

**Description:** Validate the listener plugin contract with a WeCom long-connection plugin package installed and managed through the plugin CLI.

#### Task Checklist

- [ ] Task 4.1: Define the listener-plugin adapter contract for connection lifecycle, event normalization, cursor/state persistence, and health reporting.
  - Dependencies: Milestone 2
- [ ] Task 4.2: Implement the WeCom listener plugin package against the new contract.
  - Dependencies: Task 4.1
- [ ] Task 4.3: Make the WeCom plugin installable through `orcheo plugin install`.
